# CodeAlpha-Intern
# Java Miniâ€‘Projects

This repository contains two small, selfâ€‘contained Java console applications created as learning exercises.

| Task  | File                        | Description                                                                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | `StudentGradeManager.java`  | Manage student grades: add students, list scores, and compute statistics (average, highest, lowest). |
| **2** | `StockTradingPlatform.java` | Simulate a very basic stockâ€‘trading environment with buy/sell operations and portfolio tracking.     |

Both programs are written for **JDKÂ 17+** (but will compile on JDKÂ 11 as well). They have **no external dependencies** â€” just compile and run.

## Extending the Projects

Both programs focus on core logic and are deliberately concise. Potential improvements:

* **StudentGradeManager**

  * Persist student data to a CSV or database
  * Letterâ€‘grade mapping and histogram charting
  * GUI (Swing or JavaFX)
* **StockTradingPlatform**

  * Realâ€‘time price simulation using a background thread
  * Multiâ€‘user support with login credentials
  * JSON/YAML persistence of portfolios
  * Simple REST API or web UI (Spring Boot)

Feel free to fork and enhance as you learn â€” happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
